# API Gateway with JWT Lambda Authorizer

This Terraform configuration provisions an **AWS API Gateway (HTTP API)** integrated with a **Lambda JWT Authorizer** to protect specific routes. The API Gateway routes requests to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and includes public/unprotected endpoints and authenticated routes requiring JWT validation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **HTTP API Gateway**: Lightweight, fast, and cost-effective API Gateway for HTTP-based integrations.
- **Lambda JWT Authorizer**: Custom authorizer to validate JWT tokens for protected routes.
- **Public & Protected Routes**:
  - Public routes (`/health`, `/signup`, `/login`) with no authentication.
  - Protected routes (`/users/*`, `/products/*`) requiring a valid JWT token.
- **ALB Integration**: Routes requests to backend services via an ALB.
- **CloudWatch Logging**: Access logs for API Gateway requests.
- **Terraform Provisioning**: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for repeatable deployments.

## üìê Architecture

The architecture follows this flow for incoming requests:

1. **Client** ‚Üí **API Gateway**  
   - Requests are sent to the API Gateway endpoint.
2. **API Gateway** ‚Üí **Lambda Authorizer** (for protected routes)  
   - For protected routes, the API Gateway invokes the Lambda Authorizer to validate the JWT token in the `Authorization` header.
3. **Lambda Authorizer**  
   - Validates the JWT token signature and expiration using a pre-shared secret key.
   - Returns `isAuthorized: true/false` to API Gateway.
4. **API Gateway** ‚Üí **ALB**  
   - If authorized, the request is forwarded to the ALB (e.g., `http://alb-dns-name/api/product`).

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites
1. **AWS CLI Configured** with valid credentials.  
2. **Terraform v1.0+** installed.  
3. **Variables Prepared**:
   - `alb_dns_name` (ALB DNS name from your infrastructure).
   - `bucket` (S3 bucket for Terraform state).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Terraform

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
```

### Plan Infrastructure
Preview changes before applying them:
```bash
terraform plan -var="alb_dns_name=YOUR_ALB_DNS_NAME" -var="bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
```

### Apply Configuration
Create or update AWS resources:
```bash
terraform apply -var="alb_dns_name=YOUR_ALB_DNS_NAME" -var="bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
```

### Destroy Resources
Remove all resources when no longer needed:
```bash
terraform destroy -var="alb_dns_name=YOUR_ALB_DNS_NAME" -var="bucket=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME"
```
